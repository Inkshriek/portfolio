# My Portfolio

Hello! If you're reading this, that means you're seeing the repository for my portfolio. It's where I keep links to all of my notable web development work. While I present my work in the deployed build through GitHub Pages, if you want some quick access to everything in there, you can look in this README.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and developed solely by hand, including the decorative images I'm using as custom element borders. Yes, I went pretty extra with the design. There's a lot of work that still needs to be done with it though, so expect improvements and additions over time!
