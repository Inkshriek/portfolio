# My Portfolio

Hello! If you're reading this, that means you're seeing the repository for my portfolio. It's where I keep all of my notable web development work. While I present my work in the deployed build through GitHub Pages, if you want some quick access to everything in there, here's the place.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and developed solely by hand, including the decorative images I'm using as custom element borders.
